//Subset Generation using Bitmasks
//Print all the subsets of a given array of n elements n<=20

/*
    Each element of set can be either chosen or not chosen so for each element we have 2 choices(to take or not take)
    hence for a set of n unique elements there are 2^n subsets that can be formed.

    Each subset can be represented by a binary representation where 1 represents element is taken and 0 represents element is not taken
    so by each integer's binary representation represents a unique subset of the original set.
    when the integer is from [0,2^n-1]
